## Additional Features

- Pagination - Currently the results are set at 80 oper page, but there are more than 80 results according the API. Pagination would allow the user search more results
- More filters & sort options - using the data points in the api it would be good to create more filters, possibly with sliders to allow a little more control.
- Food Search - Improve the search panel to allow users to search by food and get beers returned that are associated to the food.
- Full Details View - Instead of all the info being displayed on results view, maybe each beer could have a page, or a revealing panel that would display all the relevant info from the api
- Favourites - Allow beers to be saved for future reference.
- Helpful hints - so users can understanrd what terms such as ABV mean. These could be in the form of tool tips, ot a help panel.
- PWA - so users could add to the phone and have the data there regardless of network would also make speed improvements
